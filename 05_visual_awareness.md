# Visual awareness
**Open question**: how does thi momentary index of cortical excitability map onto visual detection performance? I need lower energy to stimulate vision if alpha waves are higher or viceversa?

### Alpha rhythm of the EEG modulates visual detection performance in humans (paper)

**Objective** 
Study the mechanism of how we perceive the world around us.

**Methods**
Peri-threshold visual laser flashed always in the same location to be perceived $50\%$ of the times during EEG recordings.
* **Participants**: twelve healty volunteers;
* **Protocol**: laser parameters (duration, intensity) identicall across all trial for each participant;
* **Paradigm**: $\text{Laser with EEG} \to \text{Response} \overset{2.5 s}{\to} \text{Laser with EEG} \to \text{Response} \overset{4 s}{\to}$;
* **Pre-stimulus analysis**: study of the relationship between pre-stimulus EEG activity and stimulus detection (state-dependency of visual perception);
* **Measure**: oscillatory activity in theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands, calculated using *fast fourier transform* (FFT).

**Results**: pre-stimulus FFT shows significant differences between detected $P_\text{yes}$ and undetected $P_\text{no}$ trials. This profile is specific for alpha oscillations and can be observed preferentially for more posterior sensors.

Spontaneous fluctuations in pre-stimulus oscillatory alpha power determine whether we will consciously perceive or not visual stimuli on a trial, by trial basis.
Alpha power may set the detection threshold of a sensory system at any given point in time:
* Lower alpha power (less inhibition) prior to stimulus, is associated with higher chance of visual detection (lower detection threshold);
* Higher alpha power (more inhibition) prior to stimulus, is associated with lower chance of visual detection (higher detection threshold). 

### Prestimulus alpha oscillations predict between subjects visual perception performance

**Objective**
Study the mechanism of how we perceive the world around us.

**Methods**
Peri-threshold visual stimuli briefly flashed centrally (beam of light) in two group participants:
1. Those who could detect the difference ($50\%$ of times during EEG);
2. Those who were unable to detect the differences between stimuli.

* **Participants**: thirty healty volunteers;
* **Stimuli**: after a fixation cross appeared for $1500-1700 ms$, a target stimulus was shown very shortly ($57 ms$). Them, a mask which consisted of an overlay of all four target stimuli appeared. Subjects were instructed to respond as fast as possible.
* **Protocol**: stimulus parameters (target stimulus) identicall but counterbalanced across all trials for each participant;
* **Paradigm**: $\text{Stimulus with EEG} \to \text{Response} \overset{2.1 s}{\to} \text{Stimulus with EEG} \to \text{Response} \overset{2.3 s}{\to}$;
* **Pre-stimulus analysis**: study of the relationship between pre-stimulus EEG activity and stimulus discrimination (state-dependency of visual perception);
* **Measure**: oscillatory activity in theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands, calculated using time-frequency analysis.

**Results**
1. **Time-frequency plot of power electrode**: differences between perceivers $P_+$ and non-perceivers $P_-$ it's most evident in the alpha frequency range ($8-12 Hz$) in the time window of $500 ms$ prior to stimulus presentation. The scalp maps indicate that alpha power was strognest at parieto-occipital electrode leads (square indicates the time window used for statistical comparison);

2. **Scatterplot between alpha power and perception performance**: shows and inverse relationship (if the alpha power is low, there is less inhibition and an higher detection rate);
3. **Power spectrum (FFT) of the resting condition with eyes open**: resting condition was recorded prior to the start of the experiment. Perceivers $P_+$ showed significantly lower alpha amplitudes than non-perceivers $P_−$.

The study shows that prestimulus oscillations can be used to predict perception performance between subjects: synchrony in the alpha frequency band (measured by power) inhibited visual perception.

### Prestimulus oscillatory activity in the alpha band predicts visual discrimination ability (paper)
**Objective** 
Study the mechanism of how we perceive the world around us.

**Methods**
Peri-threshold smaller disc superimposed to bigger discs of different contrast flashed always in the same location to be perceived $50\%$ of the times during MEG recordings.

* **Participants**: eight healty volunteers;
* **Protocol**: stimuli parameters (adjusted individual intensity) identicall across all trial for each participant. Participant in a shielded room.
* **Paradigm**: $\text{Stimulus with MEG} \to \text{Response} \overset{2.5 s}{\to} \text{Stimulus with MEG} \to \text{Response} \overset{3.5 s}{\to}$;
* **Pre-stimulus analysis**: study of the relationship between pre-stimulus EEG activity and stimulus detection (state-dependency of visual perception);
* **Measure**: oscillatory activity in theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands, calculated using *fast fourier transform* (FFT).

**Results**
* Topography of the difference in the alpha band between misses and hits averaged over subjects;
* Sensors show significantly stronger alpha power for misses than hits;
* Trials of detection session sorted as function of alpha power binned into quartiles. his rates in first quartiles different hit rates in last quartile;
* No difference for RT when sorted according to alpha power quartiles.

We can conclude that:
* Alpha power correlates with contrast-discrimination in a simple visual task;
* An increase in posterior alpha power correlates with a decrease in discriminination ability (inhibition hypothesis);
* Increase in posterior alpha activity reflect active inhibition of posterior areas.

**Magnetoencelography (MEG)**: measures electric and magnetic fields induced by action potential. The activity is small, need to insulate the brain wrt the body.

## An open question: what is the functional benefit of actively inhibiting posterior areas?
One advantage might be to reduce the flow of information which could interfere with processing in higher order areas (i.e. inhibitory feedback, there are other tasks to handle).
For example:
* **Spatial attention**: alpha power is increased in occipital areas ipsilateral to the hemifield attended to (i.e. I'm preparing to visualize something, I inhibit the other areas for optimization);
* **Working memory maintenance**: alpha power is increased in occipital areas during working memory retention.

Pre-stimulus alpha band power biases visual discrimination confidence, but not accuracy.
Excitability of the visual cortex has been directly linked to fluctuations in the power of alpha band oscillations human EEG recording.
Accordingly, several works have found tha variability in the direction of near-threshold visual stimuli is explained by variability in alpha-band power, just prior to stimulus onset.
 
A now-typical finding is that the probability of detecting a visual stimulus increases when pre-stimulus alpha power is low. However, the reason for an increased probability of detection could be explaine by two mechanism:
* **Effective change in perceptual sensitivity**: less energy require to fire the neurons means that the threshold is lower;
* **Change in response criterion**: take in account the recently stimuli, in a propension to respond or not.

It remains unclear wheter changes in alpha power effectively predict the former or the latter mechanism. It might still be that the increased probability of detection when alpha power is low could be due to the fact that people will tend to more likely report a percept, independently of whetere the stimulus was effectively there.

## Signal detection theory (SDT)
The internal response probability of ouccurence curver for noise-alone and signal-plus-noise trials represents the relationship between the signal and the noise: does alpha power change this threshold? Is alpha power dealing with accuracy or with the internal probability distribution?

With different alpha powers we can have different criterion response (effect of shifting the criterion, we have more conservative response or a more liberal response).
<center>  <img  src=https://i.ibb.co/NW6hVsp/photo-2021-05-02-19-30-39.jpg  width="500px"  />  </center>

When the noise is greater, the curves are wider (more spread), and there is more overlap.
Viceversa, when there is less noise, the curves are well separated.

**Discriminability index** $d'$: the discriminability of a singal depends both on the separation and the spread of the noise-alone and signal-plus-noise curves.
This means that discriminability is made easier either:
* By increasing separation (stronger signal);
* By decreasing the spread (less nosie).

In either case, there is less overlap between the two occurence curves, with $d' = \frac{\text{Separation}}{\text{Spread}}$.
This number is an estimate of the strenght of the signal. The reason why it's so widely used, is that values doesn't depend upon the criterion the subject is adopting, but is a true measure of the internal response.

In 2016, **Limbach** and **Corballis** performed a SDT analysis of detection performance as a function of prestimulus alpha levels. They observed that response criterion, and not $d'$, was related to prestimulus alpha, such that observers adopted a more conservative criterion when alpha power was high, and a more liberal when alpha power was low.

### How prestimulus alpha changes subjective and objective responses in a discrimination task with equally probable stimuli, where criterion is presumably balanced?
**Background and hypothesis**
Changes in criterion have been linked to changes in subjective awareness reports. Therefore, pre-stimulus alpha may impact confidence ratings, but should not affect discrimination accuracy.

When cortical excitability is non-specifically inreased, neurons representing the presented stimulus (correct choice), as well as those representing the non-presented alternative (incorrect choice), should both increase their firing rates by the same amount, leaving discriminability between the two unaffected.

On the other hand, if confidence is driven primarily by evidence in favour of the decision, rather than the balance of evidence for both possible choices, then the confidence will be systematically higher when cortical excitability is higher (alpha power is low), despite no change in accuracy.

**Participants**: ten healty volunteers;
**Protocol**:
<center>  <img  src=https://i.ibb.co/L81jmxg/method.png  width="400px"  />  </center>

**Accuracy**: is the gabor patch (different contrast of grey) tilted leftward or rightward?
**Confidence**: rate your confidence from low to high ($1-4$).
In the while EEG is concurrently recorder.

Note: high confidence means that the stimulus is easy to perceive, low confidence means the the stimulus is comple to perceive.

**Results**
The results of a single-trial regression of confidence and accuracy on power, revealed that prestimulus low-frequency power priot to target onset was negatively correlated with confidence ratings, but not discrimination accuracy.

Alpha power represents the internal state while interpreting the external environment: the lower the alpha power, the higher the confidence rating, hence alpha power does not account for accuracy.

**Conclusions**
These findings show that oscillaotry alpha power is responsible for subjective rather than objective measure of perception.

The ability to induce a dissociation between subjective and objective measures of perception could be an import tool for teasing apart the functional and neural basis of subjective awareness, while controlling for basic task performance cnfounds.

This study shows that it's possible to dissociate confidence from accuracy soleley on the basis of pre-stimulus brain states, measurable with EEG.

### Neural correlates of subjective vs. objective measures of perception (paper)

**Research question**: if alpha power codes solely for the subjective experience of confidence during a perception discrimination task, what is then the neurophysiological correlate accounting for perceptual accuracy?
**Aim**: teasing apart subjective (confidence) vs. objective (accuracy) neurophysiological correlates of visual experience (unpack the complexity of the system).

**Prestimulus alpha parameters**
Two main parameters:
* **Power**: amplitude peak to peak (subjective confidence?);
* **Frequency**: duration of one oscillatory cycle (objective accuracy?).

**The power hypothesis (subjective confidence) and sampling rate hypothesis (objective accuracy) in decision-making process**
In this manner our brain is constantly updating informations, taking them in chunks (i.e. with a faster speed of the alpha we have better sampling):
* **High alpha power** means low cortical excitability (active inhibitory state), hence **low confidence** (*conservative response*);
* **Low alpha power** means high cortical excitability (neurons more prone to fire), hence **high confidence** (*liberal response*).

While:
* **Slow alpha rhythm** ($8 Hz$) means slower real time info update, hence a lower temporal resolution, accumulating less evidence. Does it means a lower accuracy?
* **Faster alpha rhythm** ($12 Hz$) means faster real time info update, hence an higher temporal resolution, accumulating more evidence (better external representation). Does it means an higher accuracy?

**Methods**
Samples of stimuli of different contrasts:
1. Catch stimulus;
2. Low contrast stimulus;
3. High contrast stimulus;
4. Maximum contrast stimulus.

* **Participants**: twentyfour healty volounteers;
* **Titration task**: after a first experiment to identify the individual threshold of presence or absence of circles within the chekcerboard, the main experiment was performed using the threshold stimulus.

* **Pre-stimulus analysis**: study of the relationship between pre-stimulus EEG activity (power and accuracy) and subjective confidence vs. objective accuracy. Dissociating subjective vs. objective measures of visual performance, is it possible to unpack the problems in two different mechanisms?

**Scientific question #1**: do spontaneous fluctuations in posterior alpha power predict the level of subjective confidence independently of objective accuracy?

**Results**: neutral cue alpha power predicts subjective confidence: 
* The lower the contralateral alpha power, the higher the confidence; 
* Pre-stimulus alpha power doesn't relate to objective accuracy.

**Scientific question #2**: do spontaneous fluctuations in posterior alpha frequency predict the level of objective accuracy independently of subjective confidence?

**Results**: neutral cue alpha power predicts objective accuracy:
* Faster alpha frequency predicts correct responses;
* Pre-stimulus alpha frequency doesn't relate to subjective confidence.

**Conclusions**: 
We have limited predictive capacity of what will be happening next (helps a lot in modelling the brain). What we think we see might non correspond to what is effectively presented.
Power and frequency are dissociated.

What happens if we use a valid cue, when contextual information is provided fo allowing top-down prediction of the to be attended location (informative cue)?
Performance is significantly improved in the predictive task:
* The lower the contralateral and the higher the ipsilateral alpha power, the higher the confidence (alpha power desynchronized);
* The lower the contralateral and the higher the ipsilateral alpha power, the higher the accuracy.

Hence, contralateral faster alpha frequency predicts correct responses.
There is a better perfomance in the predictive cue rather than the neutral cue.
Top-down alpha power:
* Decreases at posterior electrodes controlateral to the attended location,
* Increases at posterior areas controlateral to the unattended location.

Alpha frequency speeds-up exclusively in the occipital area controlateral to the to be attended location.

## Final remarks
When spatial occurence cannot be predicted (neutral cue $X$) spontaneous fluctuations of alpha power in space may serve a generative perceptual processes by which we guess (perceptual hypothesis) where next stimulus will be presented:
* **Low cortical excitability** (higly synchronized alpha power) represents the null hypothesis $H_0$, that no stimulus is going to appear at that location (*conservative criterion*);
* **High cortical excitability** (desynchronized alpha power) favor the alternative hypothesis $H_a$ that the stimulus will appear at that location (*liberal criterion*).

Alpha speed accounts for the spatio-temporal resolution of the visual system and predicts objective accuracy. By setting the pace of visual temporal units refresh rate and the updating of sensory input information:
* **Faster alpha oscillations** will lead to higher sampling resolutions, hence a more accurate spatio-temporal information decoding (efficient neural coding, segregate information);
* **Slower alpha oscillations** will lead to lower sampling resolutions, hence a less accurate spatio-temporal information decoding (lesneural coding, integrate information).

When we have some contextual information, the visual system optimizes the top-down control of alpha power, to allocate faster sampling rate (faster alpha frequency) exclusively at the attended location, in order to match what we think we see with what is effectively out there.
