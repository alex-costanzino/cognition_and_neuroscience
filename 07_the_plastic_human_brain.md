# The plastic human brain
The human brain has flexibility thanks to the way neurons communicate.

## Hebbian plasticity
Repetitive activation of neuronal circuit can induce long-term changes in subsequent responses generated by synapses in different regions of the brain.
Such synaptic plasticity is regarder as the cellular basis for develpmental and learning-related changes in the central nervous system (there are fundamental changes in different age stages).

For example, when an axon of cell $A$ is near enough to excite a cell $B$ and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that $A$ efficiency, as one of the cells firing $B$, is increased: every time $A$ successfully excites $B$, it is like their connection gets strengthened so that, the next time, there response will be faster.

Evidence in macaques and humans has provided important insights on the role of **feedback projections** from extrastriate areas (V5) to primary visual area (V1) in visual awareness: it behaves as a filter of useful information.
The information has to come from the retina, but also has to go up to higher level regions (i.e. V5 create a simplified model for V1).

The state of connectivity between extrastriate areas and V1 impacts visual awarenees has still to be determined.

Examples of visual motion perception (from easy to complex):
* Low level movinf percepts (sensitivity wrt global movement, how many particles are needed?);
* Biological dot-pattern motion;
* High-level human movements.

**Key concepts**
* **Connectivity**: how visual motion areas are connected? Can we change these connection for enhance i.e. vision? Repetetive modulation of some network in a direction can change connectivity and then performance. We can do this artificially;
* **Brain plasticity**: how changing the weight of a connection modulates the perception of motion? 

For example we can change the minimum number of coherent particles to see the global movement (change the *signal to noise ratio*).

### Strengthening functionally specific neural pathways with transcranial brain stimulation (paper)

**Aim of the study**: causally test how the feedback connectivity from motion visual area V5 to primary cortex area V1 affects sensitivity to motion.

**Method**: direct modulation of connectivity using a novel *cortico-cortical associative stimulation paradigm* (ccPAS, two TMS pulses are fired in two different areas of the brain, possibly with a delay).

Hebbian-like plasticity has been found at various scale of neural organization. from single synapses in slice preparations, to in vivo expression in mammals.
Since neurons are clustered in functional connected groups, there's no need to stimulate exactly a precise neuron (i.e. via TMS), but a neuronal population.

Can we strenghten V5-V1 connection to improve visual motion sensitivity?
Each group was subjected to a different kind of stimulations, each one changing one parameter so to have meaningful control data.

The natural path is:
> V5 (motion detection area) $\to$ Backprojection V5-V1 in $20 ms$ (awareness of motion) $\to$ V1 (visual awareness).

Our experimental condtion consists in:
1. Experimental group direction $\text{CTRL}_{V1-V5}$
> TMS stimulation of V5, with $180$ pulses and $10 s$ breaks $\overset{20 ms}{\to}$ same TMS stimulation of V1.

2. Control group direction $\text{CTRL}_{V1-V5}$
> TMS stimulation of V1, with $180$ pulses and $10 s$ breaks $\overset{20 ms}{\to}$ same TMS stimulation of V5.

3. Control group direction $\text{CTRL}_{0 ms}$
> TMS stimulation of V1, with $180$ pulses and $10 s$ breaks $\overset{\text{no timing}}{\to}$ same TMS stimulation of V5.

4. Control group placebo $\text{CTRL}_{\text{sham}}$
> No TMS is actually applied.

Other parameters are:
* Intensity: $70\%$;
* Frequency: $0.01 Hz$ (hence the $10 s$ breaks)
* Stimulation on the inions (point of the cranium).

**Experimental procedure**
Five times stimulation, im both hemifields, with four groups

**Trial sequence**
Two alternatives forced choice by computerized task: towards which direction dots are coherently moving (right or left)? Answer accurately, if not sure, guess:

Motion sensitivity threshold (MST) is the minimum percentage of coherent particles necessary to discriminate the coherent direction of the moving fots with an accuracy of $75\%$. Can we manipulate participants threshold?

**Results**
* Baseline corrected: subjects changed performance in time, but mostly wrt their group. There is a significant improvement of motion perception, $30 m$ and $60 m$ after ccPAS, and it's notable only in the experimental condition.

* Within group

Hence, ccPAS over two functionally connected visual regions improves visual processing depending on the parameters of stimulation (i.e. directionality, timing, etc...).
Moreover, empowering reentrant connections from V5 to V1 (implied in perception of visual motion) boosts visual motion sensitivity.

These results provide first causal evidence that selective empowering of reentrant projection from V5 to V1 can **enhance visual processing of motion**.

**Conclusions**
* Functional connections are higly plastic in the brain (follow Hebbian rules);
* Feedback connectivity allows for efficient processing of information;
* Cognitive neuroscience developments have allowed for causal testing of such principles in the human brain.
