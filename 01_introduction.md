# Introduction
**What is cognitive neuroscience?**
It's the study of the neural processes and aspects underlying *cognition* (relationship between structure and function).
We can think of it as the intersection between:
* **Neuroscience**: the science of the neuron, that is more concerned about the *structural aspect*;
* **Cognitive science**: the science of *cognition*, that is the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and undertanding through thought, experience and senses, which is more concerned about the *functional aspect*.

The term was first coined in 1976 by pyschologists, in particular by the pioneers Michael Gazzaniga (cognitive neuroscience) and George Armitage Miller (cognitive psychology).

From a philosopical perspective: how the brain creates the mind?

## An historical perspective pt. 1
Philospers have always been intersted in the mind-body problem.
* **Aristotle** (384-322 BC): the brain is the body cooling system and the intelligence is in the heart;
* **Galenus** (129-210 AC): he first claim that the mind was *localized* in the brain (concept of localization of the function, different brain areas has different tasks). 
For him the rational soul is in the brain, the spiritual soul in the heart and the appetitive soul in the liver. 
Galenus thought that the personality and the emotion were generated by other organs rather than the brain.
Moreover, he claim that there is no physical distinction between the mental and the physical: mind and body are not separate faculties and this could be scientifically proven;
* **Andrea Vesalius** (1514-1564): came to know Galenus studies on monkeys, but unlike him, he believe that the brain and the nervous system are center of mind and emotion;
* **Renè Descartes** (1596-1650): for Descartes there is a sharp distinction between physical and mental: the human body is a machine made of 'extendend substance' (*rex estensa*), but the mind or soul must be a separate entity, made of a non-spatial, invisible 'thinking substance' (*rex cogita*).
He recognized that the brain has a key role for sensory input and motor output, but this didn't make the basis of the mind. 
Nevertheless, he thought that the brain had a key role in linking matter and mind: physical bodies in the world have an impact on the sense organs, and this impact creates motion in the body nervous system that is somehow translated into the experience of colour, sound and other sensations. 
Physical experiences are transmitted to the pineal gland, where they act as cues to the rational soul, enabling this to have specific types of conscious experiences or ideas. We know that Descartes was wrong about the role of the pineal gland, but i.e. from a recent proposal, neural activity in the fusiform region of the brain somehow leads to the conscious experience of a face.
Descartes also made distinction between bottom-up (body) and top-down (soul) processes: conflicts between passions and will occour when body and soul cause opposing movements in the pineal gland, the uniqe structure where body and mind interact.
The interplay between these processes in determining the outcome of cognitive processes remains a common motif in contemporary cognitive neuroscience;
* **Baruch Spinoza** (1632-1677): devoted in trying to put the physical and mental back together. He proposed that they're different aspects of the same extended substance;
* **Gottfried Leibniz** (1646-1716): proposed that body and mind are separated substances but constructed from the outset and run together in perfect armony. There is no mind-body interaction but a non-causal relation of harmony, parallelism and correspondence between mind and body;
* **Offray de la Mettrie** (1709-1751): matter is fundamental and is the cause of mental events. Volountary cognitive processes results from more complex mechanism than involuntary and istinctive processes;
* **David Hartley** (1705-1757): sensations were paralleled by vibrations in nerves and brain, providing the basis of modern physiological psychology;
* **Franz Joseph Gall** (1758-1828): attempted to localize in the brain the powers of mind. Pioneer in the study of localization and founder of phrenology (observations of skull and facial features to determine personality, hence he divided brain in functional areas);

**Libet experiment and free will**
The experiment is based on EEG observation with the instruction: 'whenever you want you can move your wrist, but watching the clock and tell the time'.
The EEG showed that brain activity starts before (about 0.15 seconds before moving the muscle, but the signal ramps up 0.55 seconds before) the moving of the wrist.
The brain shows signs of being about to produce a muscle motion about 0.4 seconds before we report that we are *aware* of having made a decision.
Free will is the interruption between internal self and external self.  

**What is function?**
What qualities make the neural base of a function amenable to experimental studiey? 
*Construct validity*: conscientiousness is a valid construct in pyschology, one of the big five dimensions along which an individual personality can vary, and it's formalized as a statistical factor to which many traits contribute. Note that not all describable traits are easily reduced to a neural level of analysis.

* **Pierre Flourens** (1794-1867): disproved phrenological claims. When cerebellum of dogs and pigeon is damaged, locomotor coordination is disrupted but had no effect on sexual arousal, as Gall's model predicted;
* **John H. Jackson** (1835-1911): Jackson studied epileptic patients, where he found out that these patients often made the same tonic-clonic movements during their seizures. This led Jackson to believe that they must be occurring in the same place every time, so he proposed that specific functions were localized to specific areas of the brain;

**Somatotopy and topographic organization of a function**
The organization of the brain can mirror the organization of the body, i.e. areas of the brain that controls muscles of the fingers are adjacent to areas of the brain that controls muscles of the palm and so on.
Functions of what came to know as a *motor cortex* are physically laid on the surface of the brain as a sort of map of the body. 

* **Immanuel Kant** (1724-1804): denies that psychology is a science because scientific methods require use of mathematics and experimentation, while mental phenomena vary in only one dimension, time. Moreover he thought that experimentation could not be applied to mental phenomena since they're private and inaccessible to experimental manipulation (psychology and physiology distinction).

## Psychology
* **Gustav Fechner** (1801-1887): the development of pshychophysics can be seen as a reaction against the idea that mental phenomena are not amenable to experimental study and mathematical modelling. Fechner believed that mind and body where two aspects of a single entity and that mental processes could be measured.
His psyhcophysics method demonstrated that mental experiences (sensations) vary in intensities and there is a *threshold* for stimulus intensity, which below there is no sensation. 
He found out that the relationship between subjective sensation and physical stimulus intensity was logarithmic (*Weber-Fechner law*).
He also speculated that there is a similar logarithmic relation between individual sensation and neuraly activity but had no way to measure it.
$$ \text{stimulus} \overset{\log}{\to} \text{sensation} \overset{\log}{\to} \text{neural activity} $$
Fechner succeded in showing that mental could be measured and was closely linked to the physical;
* **Frans Donders** (1818-1889): established the reaction time as an important technique for measuring the duration of mental events. 
He found out that simple reaction times (one stimulus, one possible response) were always faster than choice reaction times (more stimuli, more possible responses). He proposed that this difference reflected the purely mental processes of making a choice.
The subtraction method for isolating correlates of mental processes later became the standard procedure in functional brain imaging;
* **William James** (1842-1910): the father of modern psychology, he describe it as the science of mental life, including its phenomena and conditions.
He embraced a monist approach, dismissing the dualist concept of soul or mind.
He pointed out that mental processes can be abolished by brain injuries or altered by drugs, hence physiology is needed to understand psychology.
He introduced psychophysics as the study of relation between physical stimuli and reportable sensations, and made a tight link between the study of consciousness and results on psychophysics experiments on attention, memory, perception and underlying physiology.

## Physiology
* **Hermann von Helmoltz** (1824-1887): started his studies on physiology when the dominant idea was that living processes could nevere be reduced to the mechanical laws of physics and chemistry.
Nevertheless he develope the myograph, and measured the speed of travel of nerve impulses (*'velocity of thought'*), leading to the development of reaction time tasks.
He proposed the idea that perceptions are unconscious inferences, a concept developed 100 years later.

**The neuron hypotesis**
Proposed by **Santiago Ramon y Cajal**, based on a system developed by **Camillo Golgi** to stain individual nerve cells.
The neuron is a discrete cell and is the primary computational unit of the nervous system.

## Neuropsychology
**Emil du Bois-Reymond** demonstrated the electrical basis of nerve impulse and around the same period motor and sensory regions were located in the brain, then **Korbinian Brodmann** had begun to identify discrete brain regions (*brain taxonomy*).
* **Paul Broca** (1824-1880) and **Carl Wernicke** (1848-1905): first serious attempts to localize mental functions to specific locations in the brain, achieved studying effects of injuries to different parts of the brain on psychological functions. Lesions cause specific behavioural changes, strongly supporting the localizationist view.
In 1861, Broca came across a man who was able to understand language but unable to speak. It was later discovered that the man had damage to an area in his left frontal lobe (Broca's area).
Later, Carl Wernicke found a patient that coul speak fluently but non-sensibly. The patient had a stroke that damaged the area were left parietal and temporal lobes meet (Wernicke's area).

Neuropsychology relies on the logic that one way to undestrand how a system works is to sistematically remove (or inactivate) parts of it and observe how the removal of each part affects the system's functioning (*causal modulation*).

Lesion studies have played and play a critical role: many questions about physiology and anatomy cannot be answered scientifically without carrying out experiments that are invasive.

## An historical perspective pt. 2
**Behaviourism**
At the start of the 20th century the american pragmatism led to behaviourism to dominate until 1960. Psychology is a purely objective, experimental branch of natural science, that need introspection as the other science. The approach is hence is scientific and measurable.
The behavioursts built-up fundamental concepts as classic and operant conditioning, based on the ideas of **Ivan Pavlov**. Their manifesto is that psychology is the science that predicts and controls behaviour, for them thoughts and imagination are something unacceptable.
* **Gilbert Ryle** (1900-1976): dualist theories of Descartes and Kant would led to the dogma of the ghost in the machine. To understand how the machine (body) works we have to understand the soul (mind).
Talking about mind as an entity that does things is a mistake. Mental activities are processes, properties of people, rather than entities.

Minds are simply what brains do, mind is the personalization of the physical brain, the self is not what the brain is, but what the brain does.

**Cognitive psychology**
In 1960 emphasis was put back on the internal representations powered by the new concept of 'information processing'. Experimental psychology gave impulse to the foundation of cognitive neuroscience.

Behavioural data do not provide enough information by themselves to explain mental processes, hence some psychologists began to investigate the neural bases of behaviour.
**Wilder Penfield** created maps of primary sensory and motor areas of the brain, stimulating cortices of patients during surgery.
**Sperry** and **Gazzaniga**'s work on split brain surgery was also instrumental in the progress of the field (hemispheres specialization, different models).

## New technologies
New brain mapping technology such as *functional magnetic resonance imaging* (fMRI) and *positron emission tomography* (PET), allowed researchers to investigate experimental strategies of cognitive psychology by observing brain function.
The underlying principles of recent fMRI technologies go back to 1878, when blood flow was associated with brain function. 
**Angelo Mosso** had monitored the pulsations of the adult brain through neurosurgically created bony defects in skulls of patients. He noted that when subject engaged mathematical task the pulsation of the brain increased locally. Then he concluded that blood flow of the brain followed function.

## The birth of congitive neuroscience
Can be dated in 1956, when a large number of cogntivists met at the MIT:
* **George A. Miller** presentet his paper 'The magical number seven, plus or minus two', that demonstrate our limited capacity in mantain information;
* **Chomsky** and  **Simon** presented their finding on computer science.

## Short-term memories (Miller's law)
In his article, Miller discussed a coincidence between the limits of one-dimensional absolute judgment and the limits of short-term memory. 
In a one-dimensional absolute-judgment task, a person is presented with a number of stimuli that vary on one dimension (i.e. 10 different tones varying only in pitch) and responds to each stimulus with a corresponding response (learned before). Performance is nearly perfect up to five or six different stimuli but declines as the number of different stimuli is increased. 
The task can be described as one of *information transmission*: the input consists of one out of $n$ possible stimuli, and the output consists of one out of $n$ responses. The information contained in the input can be determined by the number of binary decisions that need to be made to arrive at the selected stimulus, and the same holds for the response. 
Therefore, people's maximum performance on one-dimensional absolute judgement can be characterized as an information channel capacity with approximately 2 to 3, which corresponds to the ability to distinguish between four and eight alternatives.

## Split brain surgery
Split-brain is a type of disconnection syndrome when the corpus callosum connecting the two hemispheres of the brain  is severed to some degree. It is an association of symptoms produced by disruption of, or interference with, the connection between the hemispheres of the brain. 
 The surgical operation to produce this condition corpus callosotomy involves transection of the corpus callosum, and is usually a last resort to treat refractory epilepsy. Initially, partial callosotomies are performed; if this operation does not succeed, a complete callosotomy is performed to mitigate the risk of accidental physical injury by reducing the severity and violence of  epileptic seizures. 
Before using callosotomies, epilepsy is instead treated through pharmaceutical means. After surgery, neuropsychological assessments are often performed.

After the right and left brain are separated, each hemisphere will have its own separate perception, concepts, and impulses to act. Having two "brains" in one body can create some interesting dilemmas. When one split-brain patient dressed himself, he sometimes pulled his pants up with one hand (that side of his brain wanted to get dressed) and down with the other (this side did not). He also reported to have grabbed his wife with his left hand and shaken her violently, at which point his right hand came to her aid and grabbed the aggressive left hand. However, such conflicts are very rare. If a conflict arises, one hemisphere usually overrides the other.

When split-brain patients are shown an image only in the left half of each eye's visual field, they cannot vocally name what they have seen. This is because the image seen in the left visual field is sent only to the right side of the brain. Communication between the two sides is inhibited, so the patient cannot say out loud the name of that which the right side of the brain is seeing. 
A similar effect occurs if a split-brain patient touches an object with only the left hand while receiving no visual cues in the right visual field; the patient will be unable to name the object, as each cerebral hemisphere of the primary somatosensory cortex only contains a tactile representation of the opposite side of the body. If the speech-control center is on the right side of the brain, the same effect can be achieved by presenting the image or object to only the right visual field or hand.

The same effect occurs for visual pairs and reasoning. For example, a patient with split brain is shown a picture of a chicken foot and a snowy field in separate visual fields and asked to choose from a list of words the best association with the pictures. The patient would choose a chicken to associate with the chicken foot and a shovel to associate with the snow; however, when asked to reason why the patient chose the shovel, the response would relate to the chicken (i.e. 'the shovel is for cleaning out the chicken coop').
