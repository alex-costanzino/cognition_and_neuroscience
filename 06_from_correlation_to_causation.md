# From correlation to causation
So far we've studied correlational relations between brain states and the capacity of the visual system. Now we'll se that is possible to study causational relations, entraining brain oscillations to shape sensory processes and drive behaviour.

Showing a correlation, in fact, does not imply a causation, and the previous studies did not provide any information about a causal relationship between alpha bands and functional activities of the brain because they could not explain if this represents a mere epiphenomenon or a causal role in brain processes.

Nonetheless, this step from a correlational approach to a causal approach can be done by shifting from a mere observation of the phenomena to an active manipulation of brain oscillations aimed at their entrainment (synchronization), something that can be achieved with the help of rTMS (rhythmic TMS).

## Online TMS and EEG combination
The interactive approach of combining TMS with EEG turns out to be very useful,  to explore where, when, and how TMS affects a functional network during a cognitive task (i.e. example interacting with ongoing oscillations and test their functions).

The idea is to stimulate the brain with TMS pulses and check the records of the EEG. To make it so a TMS-compatible EEG system is needed to:
* Avoid saturation of amplifiers;
* Using high sampling rate;
* Avoid circular loops (that causes heat).

The system is built-up with special materials and dedicated EEG electrodes.
Nevertheless, TMS magnetic field induces sharp electrical artifacts in the EEG recordings (i.e. recharging artifacts). An *independent component analysis* (ICA) is used to filter these artifacts.

**Inductive approach**: evoked potentials generated by TMS (called TEPs) are measured at the cortical, to assess cortical reactivity and connectivity.
Usually evoked potential are visual stimulus or TMS pulses.

**Interactive approach**: exploit where, when and how TMS affects a functional network during a cognitive task (i.e. interacting with ongoing oscillations and test their functions).

**Triggering and resetting the natural oscilations of the target site by a single TMS pulse**
If we apply a series of TMS pulses in the back of the brain (V1, V2, but not parietal or motor sites) at rest, we can see a general reaction across the frequency, with some higher responses (peaks, red areas).

Note: as expected the back of the brain resonates more in alpha frequency.

### Remark from previous topic
So far, we said that pre-stimulus alpha power is linked to subjective confidence, while pre-stimulus alpha frequency is linked to objective accuracy. Hence, as perception is something completely related to an individual, it should be evident that perception can be measured in function of subjective confidence, while accuracy has nothing to do with it as it is not related to an individual’s awareness.

Anyway, depending on the kind of experiment, perception can be measured in two different ways:
* For experiments involving a *perception task*, those in which there are stimuli involving **a single option** and subjects are asked to say **whether they perceived it or not** (i.e. they have seen the phosphene or they have seen the laser on the screen), it is the act itself of perceiving, that measures the confidence, indeed objective accuracy and subjective confidence are merged together and it is not possible to evaluate them separately, being the response completely biased by the perception of the subject (that is, there is no way to know if the subject has unconsciously seen the stimulus but not strongly enough to be consciously perceived);
* For experiments involving a *discrimination task*, those in which there are stimuli involving **multiple options** and subjects are asked to say **which option did they see** (i.e. they have seen a chessboard with grey disks or without them), we are able to distinguish between accuracy and confidence as subjects are forced both to give a positive answer on the task and to rate their confidence.

## Correlation vs. causation
While a correlative mapping asks whether certain oscillations reflect mental (receptive) states and if they can be used to predict future perception, a causal mapping asks whether it is possible to actively induce oscillatory brain activity patterns to generate mental states and modulate functions.

**The entrainment hypothesis**: can a TMS train entrain oscillations at the frequency of stimulation (synchronize brain with external stimulus), if the train coincides with the natural frequency of the targeted brain area or network? Can this be used to generate mental states and modulate function?

**Correlative mapping**: observation of the EEG, info on the brain rhytms.
* Do certain oscillations reflect mental receptice states? 
* Can this used to predict future perceptions?

**Causal mapping**: manipulation with TMS, rythmic applications.
* Can we transiently induce oscillatory brain activity patterns to generate mental states and modulate functions?

The goals of causal mapping are:
1. Exploring the link between TMS input frequency and behavioural consequences (response to the task);
2. Expolring the link between TMS input frequency and EEG output frequency (response to the EEG).

### Rhythmic TMS causes local entrainment of natural oscillatory signatures (paper)
**Method**
RhythmicTMS (rTMS) at individual alpha frequency (IAF) and three control conditions over parietal cortex, at rest:
* Rhythmic stimulus (five pulses);
* Control group $\#1$: arhythmic TMS;
* Control group $\#2$: $90°$ rhythmic TMS;
* Control group $\#3$: sham condition (no stimulus).

**Effects**: we can induce entrain in the alpha band.

**Conclusions** 
Rhythmic TMS bursts over parietal alpha generator:
* Entrain alpha activity by enhancing alpha power;
* Inrease more after each pulse;
* Phase lock alpha to each pulse, depends on the alpha phase preceding the TMS train.

Results shown that, after the first two bursts that equally entrained each band from the brain in the real session as well as in the control sessions (excluding that one using a sham TMS), meaning that the first TMS bursts have an impact on brain activity independently from its rhythmicity. 
From the third burst, the entrainment focused on alpha bands only and, in particular, just around the stimulation area.

### Biasing perception via pre-stimulus short-train TMS (paper)
The aim of this experiment was to prove causality by the exploitation of rTMS bursts, calibrated to that the frequency of the stimulation would coincide with the natural frequency of alpha bands in the targeted brain area, to entrain oscillations at the frequency of stimulation and eventually show that subjects perception could be biased in desired directions thanks to this train.
Indeed, provided that the entrainment can be achieved, this synchronization in the alpha bands should enhance their power, eventually leading to a drop in the subject’s perception (inhibition process).

**Research question**: can perception be biased in desired directions with pre-stimulus TMS at alpha frequency?

**Method**
* **Participants**: fiftyone, divided in three groups of seventeen;
* **Task*** $\text{IAF} - 1 Hz$ (slower frequency);
* $\text{IAF}$ (higher power);
* $\text{IAF} + 1 Hz$ (faster frequency);detection of peri-threshold visual stimuli and subsequent confidence ratings.

Participants were split in three groups (sham control within-subjects), rhythmic TMS stimulation at: 
* $\text{IAF} - 1 Hz$ (slower frequency);
* $\text{IAF}$ (higher power);
* $\text{IAF} + 1 Hz$ (faster frequency);

**Results**
Results shown that, independently from site and side, the stimulation led to frequency and spatially specific perceptual consequences, showing that the entrainment had been successfully achieved and that its consequences were particularly noticeable for frequencies around $10 Hz$ respectively to those around $5 Hz$ or $20 Hz$, also.

As one would expect, with targets located in the contralateral area subject’s detection was reduced, while with targets located in the ipsilateral area subject’s detection was enhanced, meaning that entrainment of waves in one hemisphere entailed a desynchronization in the other one.

**Conclusions**
There is causal evidence supporting previous correlational study of functional dissociation between:
* **Alpha power**, that accounts for subjectivce confidence;
* **Alpha frequency**, that accounts for objective accuracy.

## Brain oscillations and multisensory perception
Whenever multisensory stimuli (crossmodals interactions) are presented in a small enough time-window, they get **integrated** (processed during the same time-step by the brain).

It has been shown that the time-window of integration related to visual stimuli largely varies across individuals, in fact this time window is strictly related to the frequency of the brain oscillations, and in particular to alpha waves:
* On average, alpha waves are around $10 Hz$, thus the time-window is as large as an alpha cycle, which would be of $100 ms$;
* Still, this frequency varies from $8 Hz$ to $14 Hz$ across individuals, leading to time-windows from $125 ms$ to $70 ms$.

**The double flash illusion hypothesis**
Sounds can bias the perceived number of visual stimuli in rapid sequence (there is an interaction between visual and auditorium stimulus).
This happens since, within an alpha cycle, stimuli are perceived as simultaneous, meaning that the brain is kind of sampling information coming from different senses at the rate of alpha frequencies.

Also, it has been shown that auditory stimuli have the ability to phase reset occipital oscillatory activity, hence, when the brain receives an auditory stimulus, it prepares to receive a visual stimulus as well by resetting the phase of alpha waves, and as a result, since each alpha wave restarts its phase, they get synchronized in order to respond quickly to the incoming visual stimulus.

### Individual differences in alpha frequency drive crossmodal illusory perception (paper)
**Hypothesis**: if each alpha cycle provides the temporal unit (time-window) to integrate or segregate perceptual events, a tight correlation should be exptected between individual alpha frequency (width of one cycle) and the temporal window of the illusion?

**Question 1**: is individual alpha frequency peak correlated to the temporal window of the illusion?

The experiment achieved two distinct results with two distinct procedures, respectively showing the correlation between alpha frequencies and the integration time-window and the causal relationship between the two.
* **Correlational approach**: manipulation of behavioural variable and observation of covariation of the studied physiological variable;
* **Causal approach** manipulation of physiological variable and observation of its impact on behaviour (in this case, manipulation of brain oscillations).

**Method**
At first, participants were subjected to a behavioural task (double-beep illusion) while recording their alpha frequencies by EEG, in order to find the peri-threshold of the inter-beep delay, related to each participant so that they got fooled half of the times.

Results shown that the peri-threshold delay was exactly as long as the average alpha cycle for each participant, indeed it has sense to assume that the length alpha cycle can vary a little bit according to a normal distribution, thus sometimes the brain will integrate the information and some other times not with the same probability.

**Question 2**: can tACS at different frequencues modulate the amplitude of the temporal window of the illusion (shift of the inflection point)?

Once measured their duration of the alpha cycle and, as well, their *individual alpha frequency* (IAF), each participant was subjected to three sessions of *transcranial alternating current stimulation* (tACS), respectively at frequency:
* $\text{IAF} - 2 Hz$ (slower frequency);
* $\text{IAF}$ (higher power);
* $\text{IAF} + 2 Hz$ (faster frequency);

in order to entrain their brain oscillations and see how this entrainment would reflect on their ability to respond to the task.

**Results**
Results shown that when entraining to a frequency higher than the IAF (when increasing the frequency of the alpha waves), participants were less prone to get fooled by the illusion as result of the reduction of the length of the integration time-window. 
On the other hand, an entrainment to a lower frequency with respect to the IAF enlarged the temporal window of the illusion, resulting in a lower accuracy.

**Conclusions**
The brain builds up the best sensory representation within its physiological constraints, and these constraints can be measured in the form of alpha oscillations, which represent the temporal unit of sensory processing within the visual system and could serve as a cortical scanning mechanism that cyclically gates perception.

* tACS at $\text{IAF} + 2 Hz$ (green bar) significantly reduces the temporal window of the illusion relative to the IAF;
* tACS at $\text{IAF} - 2 Hz$ (red bar) significantly enlarges the temporal window of the illusion relative to the IAF;
* tACS at $\text{IAF} + 2 Hz$ and $- 2 Hz$ (both, black bar) **causally** determines significantly different temporal window of illusion.

### Online tES and MEG and EEG combination
**Technical issues**: tACS sinusoidal electrical signal induces frequency specific noise in the MEG and EEG. Subtracting the electric noise from the signal is likely to subtract also physiologicaly relevant signal.
**Possible solution**: dissociation of surface electrical current (sensor space) from source resolved oscillatory activity (source space).

### Remarks
There is a causal role for alpha oscillations in crossmodal illusions.

When information from different sensory modalities are conflicting they can give rise to illusory phenomena. 
The double-flash illusion results from temporal and quantity disparity between the auditory and visual modalities. 
This disparity induces an illusion when one visual stimulus is paired with two auditory stimuli spaced within a time window of around $100 ms$, a full alpha cycle.

The brain builds up the best sensory representation within its physiological constraints:
* Alpha oscillations represent the temporal unit of sensory processing within the visual system and could serve as a cortical scanning mechanism that cyclically gates perception;
* Crossmodal alpha phase reset is the most likely mechanism of action conveying this effect.

What is faster or slower alpha coding for? Temporal resolution of sensory processing!
Think about accuracy: is faster alpha leading to more accurate representation of the objective measure? The number of current flashes being presented?
