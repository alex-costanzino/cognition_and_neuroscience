# Neurostimulation
The high-level goal of neurostimulation is interfering with the brain activity.

## Non-invasive transcranial brain stimulation (NTBS)
Generally they're electromagnetic tools to interact or interfere with the neural activity.

### Brief historical background
* In 1790, **Luigi Galvani** and **Alessandro Volta** first study electro-muscle stimulation and set the development of electromagnetic theory;
* In 1832, **Michael Faraday**, the father of electromagnetic introduction, developes the iron-coil apparatus: two insulated coils of wire wrapped around an iron wing. Upon passing current through one coil, a momentary current is induced in the other coil;
* In 1875, **David Ferrier** used electrical currents to directly stimulate the cortex of dogs and monkeys, demonstrating that the stimulation of the cortex follows a precise and specific map for motor functions;
* In 1896, **Jacques-Arsène d'Arsonval** first reports magnetically induced phosphenes (flickering light in the retina) by stimulation of the retina, with huge coil with current;
* In 1910, **Silvanus Thompson** second reports magnetically induced phosphenes by stimulation of the retina, but yet no motor response could be induced;
* In 1959, **Alexander Kolin** demonstrated that time-varying magnetic fields could be used to initiate muscle contractions in frog sciatic nerves. But still, only peripheral magnetic stimulation and not in humans;
* In 1976, a program started with the specific goal of stimulating cortical nerves, paving the development of *transcranial magnetic stimulation* (TMS);
* In 1985, there is the first successful study of TMS, able to induce cortical stimulation. Two years later the first safety guidelines are published;

The invasive methods are: direct cortical stimulation, deep brain stimulation (device in the basal ganglia) and electroconvulsive therapy (ethic problems).
The non-invasive methods are: transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES).

## Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
It's a non-invasive method of brain stimulation using very short pulses of magnetic energy, that induces a weak electrical current in underlying tissue (magnetic induction, impulse action potential into the brain).
Usually it induces a magnetic field at $90°$, with a butterfly coil, with an eight-shape that enables a fairly precise targeting since the maximum currenti is directly under the centre, where the two windings meet.

It can be:
* Monophasic current flow, that goes only in one direction (single pulse, paired pulses over same area, paired pulses over different ares);
* Biphasic current flow (single pulse, repetitive, patterned or rythmic).

There exists different kind of TMS coils too, such as the conic shape, for a deeper stimulation, focal or spread.

**Sham stimulation**: it consists in tilting the coil from $45°$ to $90°$ degrees off the scalp, with one or two wings of the coil touching the scalp. It's used to track brain activity. Sham TMS has also been developed to produce the same acoustic and somatosensory sensations without effective concurrent magnetic field delivered. A sham treatment is the device equivalent of a placebo, indeed it is a fake stimulation used to test the benefits of the treatment by comparing the results between the actual group and the control group.

### Research
The research is guided by and adjunct to neuropsychology and brain imaging techniques.
The idea is to create virtual lesions, momentary knock-offs of some areas of the brain, and see what is the residual capacity of the brain.
For example, through the stimulation of the visual cortex is possible to inhibit sight and induce artificial scotoma.

**How TMS interact or interfere with brain activity?** Through stimulation with magnetic fields, igniting action potentials, and then we check the EEG offline. In this manner we can try to understand the flow of informations in the brain, it's connectivity.

The research is also interested not only in correlations between TMS and neural activity, but also in trying to modulate the cerebral activity. Is also interested in the relation between connectivity and plasticity, and models to explain it.

Research is also being carried out to determine the underlying mechansims of the clinical uses of TMS: how the brain respond to same TMS? It depends on the context (there may be some APs already active).

### Clinical applications
It can be, for example, used for neurological assessment:
* **Corticospinal tract**: it's possible check at which level is the problem through the amplitude and the delay of the response;
* **Migraine**: it's possible to downregulate brain activity to help with migraines burden. In UK there are some protocols for treating migraines with TMS, shortcircuits of the migrain to improve the frequency and the pain with no drawbacks;
* Use of rTMS (repetitive) for treating schizofrenia, tinnitus (chronic noise), seizure and depression (medication have a lot of drawbacks).

### Methods
The power and the attraction of TMS (effective and non-invasive tool), enables researchers to build upon neuroimaging correlative findings. Changes in brain activity only suggest psychological relationships, but we can now design experiments to produce causal evidence linking brain with behaviour.

### Experimental issues and safety guidelines
These potential risks are empirically found. Between them:
* Risk of seizure, mainly in rTMS. They can be due to an excessive stimulator intensity, pulse frequency or train duration, but also for too short inter-train intervals;
* Interaction with implants;
* Headache, due to the stimulation of superficial head and face muscles and nerves;
* Hearing (ear-plugs are ereccomended);
* Problem of acoustic noise and somatosensory stimulation, due to the muscle twitch of the internal ears:
* Intersensory stimulation.

Hence, TMS requires stringent control conditions:
* Pulse timing contrast (i.e. $100 ms$, then $o ms$, then again $100 ms$);
* Topographic contrast (more control areas may occour);
* Sham TMS.

Moreover a safety screening it's done before the procedure:

## Transcranial electrical techniques (tES)
The tEs techinque involves the application of weak electrical currents, from $1$ to $2 mA$, directly to the head for several minutes, from $5$ to $30$ minutes.
The stimulation is delivered by a battery-driven current stimulator, through a pair of electrodes, sponges with saline solutions to reduce skin impedance.

These currents generate an electrical field that modulates neuronal activity, according to the modality of application. The technique induces a polarization that is too weak to elicit action potentials in cortical neurons, however it presumably modifies the neuronal mebrane potential, inducing a shift in the instrinsic level of neuronal excitability (*modulation of the membrane potential*, it's easier for the neruons to fire).
