# AI and consciousness
**Consciousness**: subjective personal experience of being conscious.
How can a thing that we can't measure fit the scientific view of the world?
Nevertheless, many theories are now considering consciousness as a biological evolutionary function promoting flexible and adaptative behaviour.

Consciousness contributes to responding more flexibly when automatic actions are unsuitable (so it has a functional role).

One of the main open question is: how does consciousness arise?

## Global workspace theory (GWT)
**Baars**, in 1988 and 1997, rejected the idea that consciousness doesn't play a causal role in the nervous system, but rather excercises a **global coordination and control**. For him:
> Consciousness is a supremely functional biological adaptation, a kind of gatweay: a facility for accessing, disseminating, and exchanging information, and for exercising global coordination and control. Consciousness is essential in integratin perception, thought and action, in adapting to novel cirmustances, and providing information to a self-system.

Example: if you make a speech error unconsciously you won't be able to correct it, but as soon as you become aware of it you can fix it, because consciousness create a global access to unconscious resources.

The global workspace theory (GWT) claims that conscious perceptions and actions are those that achieve access to the global workspace and are broadcast to a large audience.

**Theatre hypothesis**: conscious events happen in the theatre of consciousness:
* Consciousness is a bright spot on stage;
* This bright spot is surrounded by a fringe of events that are only vaguely conscious;
* The unconscious audience sitting in the dark receives information broadcast from the bright spot;
* Behind the scene there are a lot of unscoscious contextual systems, that shape the events happening in the bright spot.

Example: there is a dramatic contrast contrast between item accessible to consciousness and the number of unconscious neural processes going on.

This theory is heavily grounded in neuroscience:
* **Backstage**: neural processes;
* **Bright spot**: attention;
* **Rest of stage**: working memory.

Brain is structured so that few elements at a time are dealt within the global workspace. The theatre has a numerous input from the senses, but also from the overall context and connection to unconscious resources (i.e. language, skills, memories, etc...). Hence, consciousness act as a gateway (or faucet), providing global access to any part of the nervous system.

Consciousness has very definite effects and functions:
* Provide access to mental lexicon, autobipgraphical memories and the self-system;
* Recruits processors for ongoing tasks, facilitate executive decision, enables voluntary control.

Indeed, consciousness is not an epiphenomenon, but a working part of the cognitive system.
Consciousness arisen since through evolution we gathered new functions, and we need something to regulate them.

## Neural global workspace theory
A collection of specialized unconscious processors compete for access the limited capacity of the global workspace. 
This global workspace is dependent on long range circuits, involving prefrontal cortex, anterior cingular and connecting areas, in order to promote integration.

Information can be widely broadcast to other areas, creating a global availability, that results in the possibility of verbal or non-verbal reports, experienced as conscious state. Hence, a conscious state refers to the **capacity of reporting global information**.

 **Theatre hypothesis**
* Only the a bright spot on stage is conscious (very limited in capacity);
* Sensory inputs compete for access;
* The stage is the working memory;
* All other features are uncoscious, but sometimes they get access to the working memory and, have effects on the bright spot.

The theatre metaphor has been turned into several testable models:

### Cerebral Mechanisms of Word Masking and Unconscious Repetition Priming (paper)
**Dehaene** in 2001 performed test on a number of subjects that were undergone a series words on a screen while recording their brain activity through *functional magnetic resonance imaging* (fMRI).
Some of the words were clear (*unmasked*), while some other were covered (*masked*) by other visual stimuli around them.

It turned out that the two different groups of words activated completely different neural pathways, proving that masked words can unconsciously activate part of the cerebral networks for word processing and, as a consequence, there must be two different ways in which the brain process input information, depending on the fact that the input is clearly understandable or should be undergone a sort of pre-processing.

## Future perspective
Future perspectives regarding cognition and neuroscience are believed by many researchers to be strictly related to the development of new technologies and, in particular, those concerning artificial intelligence.

Almost every aspect of consciousness is still unknown, but thanks to new tools to study cerebral activities with a high resolution and new technologies able to simulate the inner functionalities of the brain, we will probably be able to make new discoveries in the next years.

Still, two main fundamental questions are open bring to many discussions:

* If you could look right inside the brain and see everything that was happening there, would you then understand consciousness? Maybe differences in connections?

* If you could exactly and precisely replicate connections as you find them right inside the brain into an artificial modelling network, would you then have reproduced a conscious network?

Recently, a new project, the human brain mapping project, is developing (it's like mapping of the genome).
